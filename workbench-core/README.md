# Workbench Core

Workbench Core is a local, agentic runtime that exposes an interactive CLI for running sessions, resuming previous runs, and inspecting the resulting artifacts. It is built around a virtual filesystem (VFS) model and stores scoped data in a configurable data directory.

## Quick start

```sh
# Build the CLI
go build ./cmd/workbench

# Start a new interactive session
./workbench
```

The default run opens a Bubble Tea-powered TUI where each message you submit becomes an agent turn that can discover tools under `/tools`, execute them via `tool.run`, and interact with run-scoped files under `/workspace`. Every run creates a session and writes results into the configured data directory (default: `~/.workbench` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/workbench`).

## Commands

Most entrypoints live under `cmd/workbench/cmd` and use Cobra. Key commands are:

- `workbench` – starts a fresh interactive session with configurable goal/title/context size.
- `workbench resume <sessionId>` – resumes an existing session by creating a new run.
- `workbench list sessions` – lists all session IDs stored under `data`.
- `workbench list runs <sessionId>` – shows runs (and their statuses) for one session.
- `workbench show session <sessionId>` – prints the `session.json` metadata for a session.
- `workbench show history <sessionId>` – emits the recent operation history (JSONL) for debugging.
- `workbench show run <runId>` – prints the `run.json` metadata for a run.

## Configuration

All runtime configuration (currently just `dataDir`) is defined in `internal/config/config.go`. The CLI supports:

- `--data-dir` – base directory where runs, sessions, results, workspace, and history live (priority: `--data-dir`, env `WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR`, default: `~/.workbench` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/workbench`).
- `--workdir` / `WORKBENCH_WORKDIR` – override the directory mounted at `/workdir` inside the sandbox.
- `--context-bytes` – limits the token context saved per run (must be > 0).
- `--title` / `--goal` – defaults used when creating new runs.

The `effectiveConfig()` helper resolves the final config (including `dataDir`) before each command runs.

## Project layout

```
cmd/workbench/
  cmd/          # Cobra subcommands
internal/       # core services: app, store, tools, config, history
go.mod          # module definition and dependencies
```

You can inspect `internal/app` for the runtime orchestration (chat sessions, TUI hooks) and `internal/store` for how sessions/runs/history are persisted.

## Advantages

- **Control:** Runs entirely locally with configurable `dataDir`/`workdir`, so nothing depends on external services.
- **Transparency:** Every session and run is stored in the data directory, and you can inspect history, artifacts, or metadata via the CLI commands.
- **Reproducibility:** Sessions create structured state (`session`, `run`, `/workspace`, `/history`), making it easy to resume, replay, or audit work.
- **Explicit tooling:** Agents discover tools through the `/tools` virtual filesystem and call them via `tool.run`, so integrations are clear instead of hidden behind prompts.
